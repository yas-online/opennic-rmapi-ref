OpenNIC Remote Management Application Programming Interface - Reference Implementation.
By Martin COLEMAN.

WORK-IN-PROGRESS, do not use unless you know what you are doing. Currently segfaults if compiled using GCC, but not with TCC. I'm trying to figure out why.

Released under the GPLv3.

This is not (yet) officially related to the OpenNIC Project in any way. This is an implementation of the RMAPI specification that will get added to as new ideas are proposed and explored for the API. Others may implement their own according to the specifications, this is just mine.

Will easily fit within the MUD4TLD system, if you run it.

The example code, ex_*.php files, are free for you to do whatever you want with. Use, adapt and tweak them to your individual needs as much as you want. They are there to provide simple examples of how to interface with the OpenNIC RM API.
