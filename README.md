OpenNIC Remote Management Application Programming Interface - Reference Implementation.
By Martin COLEMAN.

Released under the GPLv2 only instead of the BSL v1.0 because the CGI Library I directly use is under the GPL.

This is not (yet) officially related to the OpenNIC Project in any way. This is an implementation of the RMAPI specification that will get added to as new ideas are proposed and explored for the API. Others may implement their own according to the specifications, this is just mine.

Will easily fit within the MUD4TLD system, if you run it.
